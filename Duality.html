          <li><b>Exercise #2.</b> Play with moving your awareness. First, move it around in your head (one ear, another ear, up, down, front, back).
            Next, observe your hand or foot while staying in the center of your head (with your eyes open).
            Now, close your eyes and try to travel to your hand or foot. Travel back to the center of your head,

            There's no perfect way to do this!</li>

        <h3>lesson 13: why do we struggle and get sick?</h3>
        <h4>key takeaways</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Life requires energy, the more powerfully you show up in the world, the more energy you need.</li>
            <li>Life is made up of cycles called <b>"Growth Periods"</b>which are periods of releasing stuck and old 
              energies and acquiring new fresh energy. This release of suck energy can cause physical, emotional and 
              mental challenges and if not approached consciously, it can lead to negative actions by us, which will
              lead to negative consequences.</li>
            <li>Running your energy can help release the stuck energy and avoid unwanted results in a <b>Growth Period</b></li>
          </ul> <br>
      </div>

      <div class="lesson">
        <h3>lesson 14: how to energize and clear your body</h3>
        <p>When you find yourself in a growth period (feeling grumpy or blameful),
           use the following five steps to heal yourself and shift back into positive energy.</p> <br>
          <ol>
            <li>Stop analyzing or blaming. Put your negative energy in check.</li>
            <li>Stop talking about what you THINK the problem is. Stop spreading your pain and confusion. 
              Avoid wreaking havoc in your life.</li>
            <li>Admit you're going through a growth period. This creates 
              neutral ground. You can say something like: "I'm having a bad day. Don't take me too seriously."</li>
            <li>Run your Earth Energy and Cosmic Energy. Shift into the positive flow of energy.
               Focus on healing yourself until you feel relief, you're no longer grumpy, and you have a deeper understanding.</li>
            <li>Practice gratitude and amusement. Feed the positive energy loop with others. Apologize if needed.</li>
